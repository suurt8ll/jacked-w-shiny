# jacked-w-shiny

My personal way of logging all the workout data and getting a good overview of it with Shiny Dashboard.

## How to get it working

Clone my repo and enter it:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/suurt8ll/jacked-w-shiny
cd ./jacked-w-shiny
```

Take a look at provided template and copy it:

``` bash
cp ./fitness-log-template.ods ./fitness-log.ods
```

Start the app, Rscript has to be installed for it to work:

``` bash
./start.sh
```

Finally go to <http://127.0.0.1:6006> and look at the sick progress you are making!
