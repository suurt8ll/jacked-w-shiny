# Jacked w/ Shiny

My personal way of logging all the workout data and getting a good overview of it with Shiny Dashboard.

## How to get it working

1. Clone my repo and enter it:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/suurt8ll/jacked-w-shiny
   cd ./jacked-w-shiny
   ```

2. Drop your data into the project's root folder.
3. Start the app, `Rscript` has to be installed for it to work:

   ```bash
   # Example command, use --help to see more.
   ./start.sh --launch-browser TRUE --browser-value chromium --host 0.0.0.0 --port 6006
   ```

Finally go to <http://host:port/> and look at the sick progress you are making!
